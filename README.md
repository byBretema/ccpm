# üì¶ YACPM - Yet Another Cmake Package Manager

![YACPM Logo](https://i.imgur.com/A2KPcdK.jpeg)

üßë‚Äçüíª Are you tired of watching time fade away as CMake recompiles Assimp for the sixth time today just because you had to do a rebuild of your own code?

üññ Have you find yourself writing below code manually?

```cmake
add_subdirectory(third_party/fmt)
find_package(fmt REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE fmt::fmt)
```

‚ö° **No worries, we‚Äôve got the solution right here!**

> Feel free to use this repository as template to init your awesome new project üòé

## üåä Flow

### üìÉ Define your dependencies

> The below example will install fmt, glfw and glm with your custom defines.

Create a simple `yacpm.toml` similar to this one:

```toml
[[git]]
repo_url = "https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt"
tag = "11.0.2"
defines = ["FMT_TEST=OFF", "FMT_DOC=OFF"]

[[git]]
repo_url = "https://github.com/glfw/glfw"
tag = "3.4"
defines = ["GLFW_BUILD_DOCS=OFF", "GLFW_BUILD_TESTS=OFF", "GLFW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF"]

[[git]]
repo_url = "https://github.com/g-truc/glm"
tag = "1.0.1"
defines = ["GLM_BUILD_TESTS=OFF", "GLM_ENABLE_CXX_20=ON"]
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Donwload, Build and Install packages

```bash
# Requires the toml package : pip install toml
# Launch each time you modify the 'yacpm.toml'
python ./yacpm.py . -i
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è On your CMake

```cmake
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
include(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/.yacpm/yacpm.cmake)
target_link_libraries(${YOUR_AWESOME_TARGET} PRIVATE ${YACPM_LINK_LIBRARIES})
```

### ‚ú® Just compile

```bash
# Opt1 - Just run the script with '-b <build_type>'
python ./yacpm.py . -b 'Release'

# Opt2 - manually if the process is complex than this
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j 16 --config Release
```

## üìù Notes

#### This script assumes that you have the following commands installed:

- cmake
- git

#### In the roadmap:

- [x] Other *git* providers [^1]
- [ ] Add option to choose CMake Generator
- [ ] Automatic lib name and target gathering [^2]
- [ ] Zip files
- [ ] Others VCS like *SVN* or *Hg*

#### Open to discussion:

- Right now it **requires a tag** in order to not fall in the trap of use a development version of a lib.

#### Lectures / Inspiration:

- [It's Time To Do CMake Right](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/)

- [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)

- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/corporateshark/bootstrapping)


[^1]: The first iteration was github only.
[^2]: For cases like glfw where its **find_package** is `glfw3` and its **link_library** is just `glfw` instead of `glfw::glfw` like the vast majority of the packages.

# Installation

```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
